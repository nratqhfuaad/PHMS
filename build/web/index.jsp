                            Throughout the history of humankind, there have been several large outbreaks of infectious diseases, and the death toll of these diseases is comparable to numbers of lives lost in wars. Within the 20 years of the 21st century, there have been numbers of large epidemics, such as SARS, H7N9, Zika, Ebola, and now COVID-19. The current fight against the novel coronavirus is not only a pressure test of China's overall medical system, but also a severe challenge to each hospital nationwide, especially in public health emergency identification speed, emergency management capacity, and the ability to reserve and distribute supplies

                    <p>
                        As the number of COVID-19 cases nationwide continues to grow, many hospitals will need to convert acute care beds into intensive care beds, and to discharge stable, COVID-positive patients to post-acute care settings such as nursing homes (also known as skilled nursing facilities, or SNFs).  In addition, nursing homes unable to care for COVID patients requiring intensive support services - or unable to isolate their COVID-positive residents - will require safe and high-quality options. To meet these challenges, we recommend designating specific nursing homes (SNFs) to serve as "COVID-19 Skilled Care Centers" (CSSCs). This site provides public health officials, policymakers, and other interested parties with information that can be used to assess the COVID-19 capability of SNFs in their metropolitan area.  For details on how the scorecard is constructed, please see our blog post, published in Health Affairs in April 2020.

                                        Many countries have halted some or all international travel since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic but now have plans to re-open travel. This document outlines key considerations for national health authorities when considering or implementing the gradual return to international travel operations.

                                        <br><br>The decision-making process should be multisectoral and ensure coordination of the measures implemented by national and international transport authorities and other relevant sectors and be aligned with the overall national strategies for adjusting public health and social measures.

                                        <br><br>The gradual lifting of travel measures (or temporary restrictions) should be based on a thorough risk assessment, taking into account country context, the local epidemiology and transmission patterns, the national health and social measures to control the outbreak, and the capacities of health systems in both departure and destination countries, including at points of entry.  Any subsequent measure must be proportionate to public health risks and should be adjusted based on a risk assessment, conducted regularly and systematically as the COVID-19 situation evolves and communicated regularly to the public.
